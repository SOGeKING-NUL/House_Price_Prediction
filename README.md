# House_Price_Prediction
Predicting house prices based on a Bengaluru house prices dataset. Reference was taken from kaggle code notebooks. I learnt something crucial doing this project, it is very important to know about the data you are working with. I would have never had the idea to use prize per sqft had I not had prior knowledge about real estate pricing.

Anyways, did use a linear regression model but tried using L1 and L2 regularization, something I learnt recently from CampusX(https://rb.gy/qerh7p). Althought this is not an end to end ML project, practing data cleaning  and model building is someting I found valuable.
